Revision history for Perl module MooX::Role::CachedURL

0.04 2014-04-28
    - Split the 'path' into 'path' and 'cache_path' attributes.
      Previously 'path' was used for both the local cache path,
      and for your to specify your own local file. That meant you
      couldn't specify your own path for local caching.

0.03 2014-03-29
    - Changed the 'expires' attribute to 'max_age', which feels
      the right name having read various caching-related things recently.

0.02 2014-03-25
    - Added 'expires' attribute, which uses Time::Duration::Parse to
      let you express the expiry time in a variety of ways.
    - Split out test package into a separate module in t/lib/
    - Added major todo items to section in pod
