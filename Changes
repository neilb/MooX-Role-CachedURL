Revision history for Perl module MooX::Role::CachedURL

0.05 2014-05-05
    - Added a test for the 'path' attribute: t/04-path.t
    - If the cache_path or path attributes reference a file ending with .gz,
      we assume it's gzip'd and transparently unzip it for you
      with PerlIO::gzip. This means that large files can be requested and
      cached gzip'd.

0.04 2014-04-28
    - Split the 'path' into 'path' and 'cache_path' attributes.
      Previously 'path' was used for both the local cache path,
      and for your to specify your own local file. That meant you
      couldn't specify your own path for local caching.
    - Added [Git::Tag] and [Git::Push] to dist.ini

0.03 2014-03-29
    - Changed the 'expires' attribute to 'max_age', which feels
      the right name having read various caching-related things recently.

0.02 2014-03-25
    - Added 'expires' attribute, which uses Time::Duration::Parse to
      let you express the expiry time in a variety of ways.
    - Split out test package into a separate module in t/lib/
    - Added major todo items to section in pod

0.01 2014-03-22
    - First release to CPAN
