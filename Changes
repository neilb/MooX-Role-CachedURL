Revision history for Perl module MooX::Role::CachedURL

0.04 2014-04-28
    - Split the 'path' into 'path' and 'cache_path' attributes.
      Previously 'path' was used for both the local cache path,
      and for your to specify your own local file. That meant you
      couldn't specify your own path for local caching.
    - Added [Git::Tag] and [Git::Push] to dist.ini

0.03 2014-03-29
    - Changed the 'expires' attribute to 'max_age', which feels
      the right name having read various caching-related things recently.

0.02 2014-03-25

      let you express the expiry time in a variety of ways.
    - Split out test package into a separate module in t/lib/
    - Added major todo items to section in pod
